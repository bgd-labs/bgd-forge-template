## Development

This project uses [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh). See the [book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html) for detailed instructions on how to install and use Foundry.
The template ships with sensible default so you can use default `foundry` commands without resorting to `MakeFile`.

### Setup

```sh
cp .env.example .env
forge install
```

### Test

```sh
forge test
```
